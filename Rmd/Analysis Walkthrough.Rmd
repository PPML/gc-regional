title: Analysis Walkthrough
---

This document will walk users through the process of producing
the results available in our manuscript. The steps for doing so 
are:

1. Calibrate the model (not described here)
2. Simulate interventions
3. Summarize intervention simulations

In order to follow the instructions in this document, 
the gcRegional project will need to be downloaded and 
loaded using the `devtools::load_all` function. If you 
have the gcRegional project open and the working directory 
is set to the main gcRegional folder, you can use 
`devtools::load_all(".")` to load the package.
