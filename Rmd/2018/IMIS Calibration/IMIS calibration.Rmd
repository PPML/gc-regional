title: Model Calibration using IMIS
---

To use IMIS, we need to ensure that our prior and likelihood
functions are on absolute-scale (as opposed to log-scale).
To do this, we will declare `'imis'` inside:

```{r}
gc_testing <- c('imis', 'logistic_screening', 'only_increasing_screening')
library(IMIS)
library(gcRegional)
```

If one refers to the documentation `?IMIS` we see that we 
need to have the `prior`, `likelihood`, and a `sample.prior`
function. The only one of these we don't yet have is 
`sample.prior`.

```{r construct sample.prior}
sample.prior <- function(n) { t(sapply(1:n, function(x) sample_prior())) }
```

```{r test if prior, likelihood, and sample.prior work correctly}
load_start("SF")
```


```{r run imis}
result = IMIS(50, 300, 10, 10)
```
